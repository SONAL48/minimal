### EDA: Financial Risk Analysis

This case study aims to give an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, we will develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project.

### Boom Bikes Sharing - Multiple Linear Regression

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/SONAL48/Boom_BikesSharing_LinearRegression)

The following article sections will briefly touch on LSTM neuron cells, give a toy example of predicting a sine wave then walk through the application to a stochastic time series. The article assumes a basic working knowledge of simple deep neural networks.

### Gesture Recognizer

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sajankedia/CNNGestureRecognizer)

Gesture recognition via CNN neural network implemented in Keras + Theano + OpenCV

Key Requirements: Python 3.6.1 OpenCV 3.4.1 Keras 2.0.2 Tensorflow 1.2.1 Theano 0.9.0 (obsolete and not supported any further)

Suggestion: Better to download Anaconda as it will take care of most of the other packages and easier to setup a virtual workspace to work with multiple versions of key packages like python, opencv etc.

### Human Activity Recognition

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sajankedia/LSTM-Human-Activity-Recognition)

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphones dataset and an LSTM RNN. Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:

WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING,
STANDING,
LAYING.
Compared to a classical approach, using a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) require no or almost no feature engineering. Data can be fed directly into the neural network who acts like a black box, modeling the problem correctly. Other research on the activity recognition dataset can use a big amount of feature engineering, which is rather a signal processing approach combined with classical data science techniques. The approach here is rather very simple in terms of how much was the data preprocessed.

Let's use Google's neat Deep Learning library, TensorFlow, demonstrating the usage of an LSTM, a type of Artificial Neural Network that can process sequential data / time series.
